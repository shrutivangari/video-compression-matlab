Video compression refers to reducing the quantity of data used to represent digital video images, and is a straightforward combination of image compression and motion compensation. Video compression is an example of the concept of Source coding in Information theory. A compressed video can effectively reduce the bandwidth required to transmit video via terrestrial broadcast, via cable TV, or via satellite TV services.
Although new storage technologies such as optical disks and new magnetic storage techniques promise some relief for the information storage problem, the amount of data being acquired is increasing rapidly, especially for 3-D surveys, and new technologies require years before achieving the reliability of standard tape storage and gaining the confidence of the industry. Data compression algorithms reduce the need for these costly new technologies.
An effective algorithm called SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences) is used to represent the amount of data to be transmitted. By using SAD as a metric, we can determine the amount of correlated data and thus eliminating the need for re-transmission of redundant data. Apart from compression, this algorithm can also be applied in other applications such as motion estimation, depth matching, obstacle detection and so on.
